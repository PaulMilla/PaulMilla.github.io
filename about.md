I'm a vim enthusiast, screen admirer, git addict who enjoys coding everything from back end network requests, to mobile apps for my service organization, to finding unsanitized comment fields in said service organization's website.

Being a very detail oriented person I often like to think about the various ways to implement a solution, and it's not uncommon for me to keep a Stack Overflow tab open even for a known problem just to see how others have solved a problem. I also enjoy using the right tools for the job. Getting the opportunity to use a new application, framework, or library is an experience and, at first, is often spent researching how it works, best use cases, comparisons, etc.
