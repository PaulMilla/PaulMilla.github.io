The Capstone program at UT pairs Computer Science students alongside Art Majors in teams of five and then simulates a real-world gaming studio by using some of the most common technologies such as Unity, GitHub, and Maya/Photoshop in a three month agile development setting using the Scrum methodology and Atlassian's Jira as an issue tracker.

As part of the full process we are assigned a team on the first day of class and immediately begin working on a pitch for our game, as well as concept documents for the asthetics, design, and gameplay. Once we present our ideas to the class we begin working on it in week-long sprints. We meet in class once a week where the teacher will present relevant information to the game design process, any additional tools we can use, and occasionally a presentation from someone in the industry. The second half of class is spend meeting with our teams to decide how successful the previous sprint was, and to plan for the next week's sprint. Near the end of the semester we are provided with playtesters for an Alpha, and Beta release of our game before finally hosting a "Digital Demo Day", in which everyone is invited to come play the games and give final feedbacks on it.
