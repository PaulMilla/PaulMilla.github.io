I'm a vim enthusiast, screen admirer, git addict who enjoys coding everything from back end network requests, to mobile apps for my service organization, to finding unsanitized comment fields in said service organization's website. Nice to meet you!

I'm also constantly looking for ways to improve my programs' efficiency often times keeping Stack Overflow open as I'm coding and refer to it whenever I think something could be done more efficiently. I might also be a little OCD about my code's readability.
